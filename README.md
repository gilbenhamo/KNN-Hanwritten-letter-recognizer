# KNN Hebrew Handwritten Letter Recognizer

This repository contains a program that recognizes and classifies handwritten letters in the Hebrew alphabet. It utilizes image processing techniques and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to accurately identify and classify Hebrew letters.
<br/>**This project was developed as part of an image processing course.**

## Environment
- Operating System: Windows/macOS
- Development Environment: PyCharm
- Language: Python
- Required Packages: cv2, numpy, sklearn

Before running the program, please ensure that you have the necessary packages installed in your Python environment.

## How to Run
To run the program, please follow these steps:

1. Format to run on the command line:
   ```shell
   python knn_classifier.py <path of the dataset directory>
   ```
2. The program will utilize image processing techniques and the KNN model to train on the provided dataset and build a recognition model.
3. Once the model is trained, you can use it to recognize and classify handwritten Hebrew letters by providing new input images.
4. Feel free to experiment with different input images and evaluate the accuracy of the recognition model.
